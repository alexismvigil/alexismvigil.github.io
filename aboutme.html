     <p>Hi friends! My name is Alexis Vigil, I also go by Lexi, 
     I'm a 21 year old full-time student at Colorado State University-Pueblo. 
     I am a Mass Communications major with an emphasis in integrated communication and a minor in health promotions. 
     I love helping people and work part-time as a nursing assistant.</p>
     
     <p>I'm very girly and love all things pink and glittery. 
     I love social media and could see myself doing something with that.
      My interests are in fashion, beauty, lifestyle, and wellness. 
      I also like to read, write, and do anything creative. 
      My hobbies include but are not limited to yoga, snowboarding, baking, and traveling.</p>
      
      <p>I'm not exactly sure what I want to do when I "grow up" but I'm really happy with the direction I'm headed and hope 
      to graduate in 2021.</p>
      
      <p>I was born in Salt Lake City, Utah and grew up in a small suburb about 30 miles west called Tooele. 
	  I am two years older than my younger brother Michael. We have a dog named Deja vu who is the sweetest yellow lab you would 
	  ever meet. I don't know about you but I have always considered pets to be more like family! I am totally a dog person and 
	  aspire to have a dog farm with lots of dogs!</p>
	
	 <p>We loved our life in Utah but in Summer of 2013 we made a move from our longtime home onto a new adventure in Colorado 
	 which we now also love! I finished high school at Pueblo County. I was a very active high school student usually always on 
	 the honor roll and played soccer all four years of high school. I also did dance and drama. Academically I took AP, biomedical
	 science, and college courses. I was involved in National Honors Society and the STEP program.</p>
	 
	 <p>I started my college career in summer 2016. I originally wanted to go for nursing but lost interest and took a year off 
	 in fall 2018. I came back in fall of 2019 and decided to switch my major to mass comm. I have to say I'm really happy with 
	 where I am at right now. I really enjoy all of my courses, I've especially taken interest in the college radio program.</p>
